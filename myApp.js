// Avoid Inferring the Response MIME Type with helmet.noSniff(). Browsers can use content or MIME sniffing to override response Content-Type headers to guess and process the data using an implicit content type. While this can be convenient in some scenarios, it can also lead to some dangerous attacks. This middleware sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to nosniff, instructing the browser to not bypass the provided Content-Type.

// Ask Browsers to Access Your Site via HTTPS Only with helmet.hsts(). HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy which helps to protect websites against protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking. If your website can be accessed via HTTPS you can ask userâ€™s browsers to avoid using insecure HTTP. By setting the header Strict-Transport-Security, you tell the browsers to use HTTPS for the future requests in a specified amount of time. This will work for the requests coming after the initial request.
